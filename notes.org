* Week 1
** Forum post: http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-12-months-of-record-setting-temperatures-looks-like-across-the-u-s/
- Originally found on Twitter, from the @DataIsBeautiful handle.
- Both the data and the procedure is available at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/us-weather-history

** Types of presentations
- Presentation (i.e. slides, static, polished)
- Interactive visualization (can interact with data, not polished)
- Interactive storytelling (polished, reacts to input of mass audience) 

** Fitt's law
600 ms + 240ms log (1+D/S)

D is distance to target, S is size of target. Example: pulldown menu, is it better to have larger or smaller menu items? Doesn't matter, since D \approx S.

** Human computation 
- Visual/auditory store -> working memory
- Working memory: up to 7 items, decay is of order 7 seconds
- Sensory memory is visual memory (iconic, echoic, haptic, arousal)
*** Long-term memory
- Episodic & semantic
- Total time & distribution tend to improve move from short to long term memory; meaning (concrete > abstract)
- Decay is logarithmic
*** Cognitive processor
- Logic, deductive reasoning: make conclusion based on data
- Inductive reasoning: make generalizations

- Abductive reasoning (why?): modeling, cognitive dissonance
*** Eyes
- Brightness -> rods, color -> cones
- Shade context, color context
- Lateral inhibition: an excited neuron can limit the activity of a neighboring neuron.

* Week 4
Schneider's mantra:
- High level overview
- Zoom and filter
- Details on demand

** Database visualization
*** Definitions
- OLAP: OnLine Analytical Processing
- Data Cube: N-d spreadsheet
- Dimension: key
- Measure: value
- Cell: element holding the specific value for each of the dimension
*** Aggregation
- Reduce dimensionality

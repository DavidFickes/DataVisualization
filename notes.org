* Week 1
** Forum post: http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-12-months-of-record-setting-temperatures-looks-like-across-the-u-s/
- Originally found on Twitter, from the @DataIsBeautiful handle.
- Both the data and the procedure is available at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/us-weather-history

** Types of presentations
- Presentation (i.e. slides, static, polished)
- Interactive visualization (can interact with data, not polished)
- Interactive storytelling (polished, reacts to input of mass audience) 

** Fitt's law
600 ms + 240ms log (1+D/S)

D is distance to target, S is size of target. Example: pulldown menu, is it better to have larger or smaller menu items? Doesn't matter, since D \approx S.

** Human computation 
- Visual/auditory store -> working memory
- Working memory: up to 7 items, decay is of order 7 seconds
- Sensory memory is visual memory (iconic, echoic, haptic, arousal)
*** Long-term memory
- Episodic & semantic
- Total time & distribution tend to improve move from short to long term memory; meaning (concrete > abstract)
- Decay is logarithmic
*** Cognitive processor
- Logic, deductive reasoning: make conclusion based on data
- Inductive reasoning: make generalizations

- Abductive reasoning (why?): modeling, cognitive dissonance
*** Eyes
- Brightness -> rods, color -> cones
- Shade context, color context
- Lateral inhibition: an excited neuron can limit the activity of a neighboring neuron.


* Week 3
** Graphs
*** Nodes & edge
- Planar graph: none of the edges cross
- Isomorphic == same embeddings
- Directed/undirected, cyclic/acyclic
- In/out degree: # of edges going in/out of a node
*** Tree
- Minimally connected
- n nodes, n-1 edges
- Can be seen as directed, with children pointing to parents
*** Social network power law
- Many nodes with few interactions
- Nodes with degree x ~ x^-\alpha
- E.g. yeast proteins have \alpha ~ -1.7
*** Adjacency matrix
- Square matrix, N x N, N = # of nodes
- A_{i, j} = 1 if i, j nodes connected
** Planar embedding
- Convert into a 2D graph without edge crossings
- Laplacian matrix, L_ij = 1/deg(i) for an edge between i and j
** Graph visualization & layout
- GEM force: spring force between nodes
- High degree nodes should be closer to the central
- Simplification: remove low centrality nodes
- Edge bundles
** Tree maps
** PCA (Principal component analysis)
- Reduce dimensionality of data by looking at the directions that give the largest variations
